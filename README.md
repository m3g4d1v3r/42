# 42 Basecamp
My 42 Basecamp code and experience!

Approved exercises have been tagged with `_ok` in their folder names. Similarly, not approved exercises have been tagged with `_ko`.

## Highlights
1. [HexMemDump](c02/ex12_ko/ft_print_memory.c): a program that's similar to `hexdump`, but instead of files it shows the contents of the current working memory (there are still some fixes to be made).
2. [SkyscraperPuzzleSolver](rush01/ex01_ok/): a program that search for one solution to the Skyscraper Puzzle (a.k.a. Tower or 3D Sudoku puzzle).
3. [TenQueensPuzzleSolver](rush01/ex01_ok/): a program that search for all the solutions to the Ten Queens Puzzle.
4. [Atoi](atoi/): an overly complicated (but not approved) atoi function with funny and interesting test cases.
